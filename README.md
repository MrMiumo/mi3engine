> **Mi<sup>3</sup> Engine** is a very basic and lightweight rendering engine written in Java intended to render Minecraft elements such as resource pack models.

## Performances
<a name="performances"></a>
Performances are not adapted to video or live preview but are still suitable for efficient image generation. Generating an image of 1287x1287 for a large model containing 400 cubes takes about 100ms (depends of the hardware of course).

## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>
This engine is written in Java 17 (maybe compatible with Java 15 but not tested). It can be added to your project using Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.mrmiumo</groupId>
    <artifactId>mi3engine</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```
Once imported in your project, you can use it by yourself (creating and adding cubes one by one) or using tools.

### Manual Usage
<a name="manual"></a>
This technique enabled you to have full control over what is used to generate your images. It is adapted when no tool already exist for your use case.</br>
Here is a small example:

```java
/* Step 1. Create the engine */
RenderEngine engine = RenderEngine.from(1920, 1080);

/* Step 2. Setup the camera */
engine.camera()
    .setRotation(25, -145, 0)
    .setTranslation(1, 0)
    .setZoom(0.32);

/* Step 3. Load your textures */
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(Files.newInputStream("myTexture.png"));
Texture texture = Texture.from(img);

/* Step 4. Create the cubes */
Cube.from(new Vec(16, 0, 16), new Vec(32, 8,  32))
    .rotation(0, Axis.Y)
    .pivot(8, 0, 16)
    .texture(Face.NORTH, texture, 0, 8, 16, 16, 0)
    .texture(Face.EAST, texture, 0, 8, 16, 16, 1)
    .texture(Face.SOUTH, texture, 0, 8, 16, 16, 1)
    .texture(Face.WEST, texture, 0, 8, 16, 16, 1)
    .texture(Face.UP, texture, 0, 0, 16, 16, 1)
    .texture(Face.DOWN, texture, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0)
    .render(engine);

/* Step 5. Render the image */
BufferedImage output = engine.render();

/* Step 6. Save the image */
ImageIO.write(output, "PNG", Files.newOutputStream("MyImage.png"));
```

### Model Parser Tool
<a name="modelParser"></a>
This method make the rendering way much easier. Tools are built-in classes that enabled to generate images for some Minecraft components such as pack models. Here is an example:

```java
/* Step 1. Create a new parser with an engine */
ModelParser engine = new ModelParser(RenderEngine.from(1287, 1287));

/* Step 2. Setup the camera */
engine.camera()
    .setRotation(25, -145, 0)
    .setTranslation(1, 0)
    .setZoom(0.32);

/* Step 3. Use the tool to convert a file and collect the created cubes */
engine.parse(pack.resolve("assets/minecraft/models/item/boat.json"));

/* Step 4. Render the image */
BufferedImage output = engine.render();

/* Step 5. Save the image */
ImageIO.write(output, "PNG", Files.newOutputStream("MyImage.png"));
```
**IMPORTANT**: When using the `ModelParser`, you must define a property called 'default.minecraft.pack' in your `application.properties` file to give the path to a folder corresponding to the default minecraft resource pack. If your project does not have such a file yet, add it in the `src/main/resources` folder and add the line:
```properties
default.minecraft.pack=/myApp/assets/minecraftDefaultTextures
```
This configuration is important since most models rely on default game's textures and those are not embedded in the engine.

### AutoFramer Tool
<a name="autoFramer"></a>
The AutoFramer tool is a patch above the render engine. It can be used alongside with any other tool!<br>
Its goal is to center the object and adjust the zoom automatically to make the object fill the final image.

```java
/* Step 1. Create the engine with AutoFramer */
RenderEngine engine = new AutoFramer(RenderEngine.from(1287, 1287));

/* Step 2. Setup the camera */
engine.camera().setRotation(25, -145, 0);

/* Step 3. Add the cubes to the engine */
engine.addCubes(myCubes);

/* Step 5. Render the image */
BufferedImage output = engine.render();

/* Step 6. Save the image */
ImageIO.write(output, "PNG", Files.newOutputStream("MyImage.png"));
```

## Future
<a name="future"></a>
A player module is planned to be added to create custom poses and render skins!
